# Cart and catalog API

## Requirements:

The API should be based on latest version Symfony framework (not on API Platform, etc.)

Client should be able to:

- add product to the catalog
- update product name, price
- add product to the cart
- cart can contain a max. of 3 products

Following aspects are not part of this exercise:
- Linter
- Authentication / Authorization (everything is just publicly available)
- Security
- Containerization (Docker)

However please show us some skills:
- SOLID principles
- Clean Code
- REST principles
- Design Patterns
- PSR standards

The delivery does not need to include a working code, we will just have a look at your coding style and ask about your decisions.

## Instalation
